# Welcome

This repo is to be used in conjunction with the DEVNET Workshops run by Bryan Byrne at Cisco Live. The current cycle is for #CLUS 2019 in San Diego California. Code contained within are for sessions:

- [DEVWKS-1001 - Hands on Exploration of NETCONF and YANG](DEVWKS-1001/Guide/DEVWKS_1001_Intro.md)
- DEVWKS-1512 - Becoming the Jinja Ninja: Using YAML and Jinja Templates to Create Reusable Code
- DEVWKS-1695 - Introduction to GuestShell
- [DEVWKS-2585 - Hands-On Kicking the Tires of RESTCONF](DEVWKS-2585/Guide/DEVWKS_2585_Intro.md)

Each session has a dedicated directory strutucture that contains all code examples covered in the workshop. 

With the exception of DEVWKS-1512 (Jinja Ninja) all labs require a target device to execute code against. In the case of Cisco Live the workstations will be provided with a Vagrant box of a CSR. Due to Cisco's software licensing restrictions I am unable to provide the Vagrant box. For details on building your own please see the DevNet Learning Lab "[Vagrant Up for Network Engineers](http://bit.ly/2HPlydE )."
