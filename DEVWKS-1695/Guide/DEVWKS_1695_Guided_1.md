# Welcome to Cisco Live San Diego!

In this session **Introduction to GuestShell** we will walk through a series of exercises to introduce GuestShell a virtualized Linux-based environment, designed to run custom Linux applications, including Python for automated control and management of Cisco devices.

In this lab we will be working directly on a CSR router. As we proceed through the lab guide all commands will be provided for you to cut and paste to limit the potential for *'User Created Issues'* in the lab.

When you see a box that looks like this:

```
Interesting text here
```
You will copy this text and paste it into the terminal. For those that aren't familiar with MacOS here is a brief cheat sheet:

### Cut - ⌘ + c
### Paste - ⌘ + v

Before we get started let's get logged into the router:

```
vagrant ssh
```
