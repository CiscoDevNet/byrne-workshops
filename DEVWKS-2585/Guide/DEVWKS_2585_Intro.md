# DEVWKS-2585 - Hands-On Kicking the Tires of RESTCONF

This document is intended to be the lab guide for DEVWKS-2585 - Hands on Kicking the Tires of RESTCONF. The delivery of this content will be/was delivered at Cisco Live San Diego. The format of the lab is broken into three major sections. In the first section the students will use command line tools to practice building RESTCONF URIs and inspect the various headers required to make a RESTCONF call to a router. In the second section students will use POSTMAN to craft and send RESTCONF calls to a device. In the final section the students will take the previous concepts and create a basic python script to modify the configuration and validate their work.
