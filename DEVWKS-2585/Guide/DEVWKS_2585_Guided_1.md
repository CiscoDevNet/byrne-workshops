# Welcome to Cisco Live San Diego!

In this session **Hands-On Kicking the Tires of RESTCONF** we will walk through a series of exercises to introduce the topics of NETCONF and YANG and how the two interact. In order to minimize the number of errors introduced by manually typing commands into the lab-top I've provided the user inputs below.

When you see a box that looks like this:

```
Interesting text here
```
You will copy this text and paste it into the terminal. For those that aren't familiar with MacOS here is a brief cheat sheet:

### Cut - ⌘ + c
### Paste - ⌘ + c

Before we get started let's make sure our command prompt is set correctly and that we are in the correct directory

```
cd DEVWKS-2585/code
export PS1='(venv)\W $ '
```

Let's get started with the lab:
